# Learning-Cpp
Me learning c++ in 2012/2013 (My first year of programming)  
long before I knew what git was. 


All .cpp files are seperate projects  
Heavy Focus on Object Oriented Programming, Pointers, Vector/String manipulation, Templating, Recursion  


Lots of ACSL (http://www.acsl.org/) code.  
They even published my code on their website: http://www.acsl.org/acsl/12-13/Contest_4/ENLOE_HS_jr_C%2B%2B.htm


Simple Stuff - Decimals, Exponents, FactSum, Fibonacci, Interest, Matrix  
Less Simple Stuff - Quadratic, SentanceReverse, TreasureHunt  
Templating - BubbleTemplate  
OOP/Pointers - Everything else.  


"Cool" is in relation to it being my first year  
Cool Stuff - TicTacToe, QuoteComp, ExpressionTree, Gut(?), TriPt(?), BinaryTree(?)
